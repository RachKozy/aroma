        <h3>Coffee Roasting</h3>
        <p>
        With over ten years of experience in the industry, we source, roast, blend and serve the best coffee in Ohio. We offer a variety of estate and co-op coffees as well as a few select and specialized blends. We value the importance of fairness and quality at each step of the process from seed to cup.

      <h3>The Art of Coffee</h3>
      <p>Roasting coffee to perfection is exacting, but not mysterious. Hereâ€™s how we do it:
			<ol>
        <li>Travel the globe to find the best coffee beans.</li>
        <li>Buy entire micro-lots of great beans at a fair price.</li>
        <li>Roast with artistry and advanced technology.</li>
        <li>Control quality from grower to roaster to barista to consumer.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

    <div class="better">
      <h3>Smaller is Better</h3>
      <p>Many of our specialty beans come from a single farm or even from a specific area on the farm, so they are limited in quantity and superior in quality. We have established strong, long-term relationships, based on good coffee and fair prices.
